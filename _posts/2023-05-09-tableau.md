In this project we build a Tableau Dashboard that will help our client find insights by drilling into the data!

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Our client has requested a dashboard that tracks global earthquake activity across a 30-day period. This will provide them opportunities to navigate the data and find insights that can lead to future projects and business value.
