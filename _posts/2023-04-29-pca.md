# PROJECT OVERVIEW <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

Our client is looking to promote Ed Sheeran's new album and wants to be both targeted with their customer communications while being as efficient as possible with their marketing budget.

As a proof-of-concept, they would like us to build a classification model for customers who purchased Ed's *last* album based on a small sample of listening data they have acquired for some of their customers at that time.

If we can do this successfully, they will look to purchase up-to-date listening data, apply the model, and use the predicted probabilities to promote to customers who are most likely to purchase.

The sample data is short but wide: it contains only 356 customers and 102 columns that represent the percentage of historical listening time allocated to 100 artists. On top of this, the 100 columns do not contain the artist in question but are instead labelled *artist1, artist2* etc.

We will need to compress this data into something more manageable for classification!

<br>
<br>
### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>

We first need to bring in the required data - both the historical listening sample and the flag showing which customers purchased Ed Sheeran's last album. We ensure we split our data into a training and test set, for classification purposes. For **PCA**, we ensure we scale the data so that all features exist on the same scale.

We then apply **PCA** without any specified number of components, which allows us to examine and plot the percentage of explained variance for every number of components. Based upon this information, we make a call to limit our dataset to the number of components that make up 75% of the variance of the initial feature set (rather than limiting to a specific number of components). We apply this rule to both our training set (using `fit_transform`) and our test set (using `transform` only).

With this new, compressed dataset, we apply a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the sales of the album and assess the predictive performance!

<br>
<br>

### Results <a name="overview-results"></a>

Based upon an analysis of variance vs. components, we made a call to keep 75% of the variance of the initial feature set - which means we dropped the number of features from 100 down to 24.

Using these 24 components, we trained a **Random Forest Classifier**, which is able to predict customers that would purchase Ed Sheeran's last album with a Classification Accuracy of 93%!

<br>
<br>
### Growth/Next Steps <a name="overview-growth"></a>

We only tested one type of classifier here (**Random Forest**) - it would be worthwhile testing others. We also only used the default classifier hyperparameters - we would want to optimize these.

Here, we selected 24 components based upon the fact this accounted for 75% of the variance of the initial feature set. We would need to search for the optimal number of components to use based upon classification accuracy.

# DATA OVERVIEW <a name="data-overview"></a>

Our dataset contains only 356 customers, but 102 columns.

In the code below, we:
* Import the required python packages and libraries
* Import the data from the database
* Drop the ID column for each customer
* Shuffle the dataset
* Analyze the class balance between album buyers and non album buyers

<br>
```python
# Import required Python packages
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Import data
data_for_model = ...

# Drop the user_id column
data_for_model.drop("user_id", axis=1, inplace=True)

# Shuffle the data
data_for_model = shuffle(data_for_model, random_state=42)

# Analyze the class balance
data_for_model["purchased_album"].value_counts(normalize=True)
```
<br>

From the last step in the above code, we see that 53% of customers in our sample did purchase Ed's last album and 47% did not. Since this is evenly balanced, we can most likely rely solely on *Classification Accuracy* when assessing the performance of the classification model later on.

After these steps, we have a dataset that looks like the below sample (not all columns shown):
<br>
<br>

| **purchased_album** | **artist1** | **artist2** | **artist3** | **artist4** | **artist5** | **artist6** | **artist7** | **…** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.0278 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0036 | 0.0002 | … |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0.0367 | 0.0053 | 0 | 0 | 0.0367 | … |
| 1 | 0.0184 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 0 | 0.0017 | 0.0226 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 1 | 0.0002 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 1 | 0.0042 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0002 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.1759 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 1 | 0.0001 | 0 | 0.0001 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0555 | 0 | 0.0003 | 0 | … |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … |

<br>
The data is at customer level: we have a binary column showing whether the customer purchased the prior album or not and 100 columns containing the percentage of historical listening time allocated to each artist. We do not know the names of these artists.

From the above sample, we can also see the sparsity of the data - customers do not listen to all artists and therefore many of the values are 0.

# PCA OVERVIEW <a name="pca-overview"></a>

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is often used as a *Dimensionality Reduction* technique that can reduce a large set of variables down to a smaller set, but still contains most of the original information.

In other words, **PCA** takes a high number of dimensions (or variables) and boils them down into a much smaller number of new variables - each of which is called a *principal component*. These new *components* are somewhat abstract - they are a blend of some of the original features where the **PCA** algorithm found they were correlated. By blending the original variables rather than just removing them, the hope is that we still keep much of the key information that was held in the original feature set.

*Dimensionality Reduction* techniques like **PCA** are mainly used to simplify the space in which we're operating. Attempting to apply the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm, for example, across hundreds or thousands of features can be computationally expensive. **PCA** reduces this vastly while maintaining much of the key information contained in the data. Using **PCA** doesn’t just have application just within the realms of unsupervised learning: it could just as easily be applied to a set of input variables in a supervised learning approach - exactly like we will do here!

In supervised learning, we often focus on *Feature Selection*, where we look to remove variables that are not deemed to be important in predicting our output. **PCA** is often used in a similar way, although in this case we aren't explicitly *removing* variables - we are simply creating a smaller number of *new* ones that contain much of the information contained in the original set.

_**Business consideration of PCA:**_  It is much more difficult to interpret the outputs of a predictive model that is based upon component values versus the original variables.

# DATA PREPARATION <a name="pca-data-prep"></a>

<br>
##### Split Out Data For Modeling

In the next code block we do two things: we first split our data into an `X` object which contains only the predictor variables and a `y` object that contains only our dependent variable.

Once we have done this, we split our data into training and test sets to ensure we can fairly validate the accuracy of the predictions on data that was not used in training. In this case, we have allocated 80% of the data for training and the remaining 20% for validation. We make sure to add in the `stratify=y` parameter to ensure that both our training and test sets have the same proportion of customers who did and did not sign up for the delivery club - meaning we can be more confident in our assessment of predictive performance.

<br>
```python
# Split data into X and y objects for modeling
X = data_for_model.drop(["purchased_album"], axis=1)
y = data_for_model["purchased_album"]

# Split training & test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)
```

<br>
##### Feature Scaling

**Feature Scaling** is extremely important when applying **PCA**. It means the algorithm can successfully "judge" the correlations between the variables and effectively create the *principal compenents* for us. The general consensus is to apply **Standardization** rather than **Normalization**.

The below code uses the in-built `StandardScaler` functionality from scikit-learn to apply **Standardization** to all of our variables. We use `fit_transform` for the training set but only `transform` to the test set. This means the **Standardization** logic will learn and apply the “rules” from the training data but only apply them to the test data. This is important in order to avoid data leakage where the test set learns information about the training data - meaning we can’t fully trust model performance metrics!

<br>
```python
# Create our scaler object
scale_standard = StandardScaler()

# Standardize the data
X_train = scale_standard.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scale_standard.transform(X_test)
```

___
<br>
# FITTING PCA <a name="pca-fit"></a>

We apply **PCA** to our training set without limiting the algorithm to any particular number of components - in other words, we're not explicitly reducing the feature space at this point.

Allowing all components to be created here allows us to examine and plot the percentage of explained variance for each component and assess which solution might work best for our task.

In the code below, we instantiate our **PCA** object and then fit it to our training set.

<br>
```python
# Instantiate our PCA object (no limit on components)
pca = PCA(n_components = None,  random_state = 42)

# Fit to our training data
pca.fit(X_train)
```

___
<br>
# ANALYSIS OF EXPLAINED VARIANCE <a name="pca-variance"></a>

There is no right or wrong number of components to use - IT is something we need to decide based on the scenario we're working in. We know we want to reduce the number of features, but we need to trade this off with the amount of information we lose.

In the following code, we extract this information from the prior step where we fit the **PCA** object to our training data. We extract the variance for each component and then do the same again but for the *cumulative* variance. Will will assess and plot both of these in the next step.

<br>
```python
# Explained variance across components
explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_

# Explained variance across components (cumulative)
explained_variance_cumulative = pca.explained_variance_ratio_.cumsum()
```

<br>
In the following code we create two plots - one for the variance of each principal component and one for the cumulative variance.

<br>
```python
num_vars_list = list(range(1, 101))

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 9))

# Plot the variance explained by each component
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.bar(num_vars_list, explained_variance)
plt.title("Variance across Principal Components")
plt.xlabel("Number of Components")
plt.ylabel("% Variance")
plt.tight_layout()

# Plot the cumulative variance
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(num_vars_list, explained_variance_cumulative)
plt.title("Cumulative Variance across Principal Components")
plt.xlabel("Number of Components")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative % Variance")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

<br>
![alt text](/img/posts/pca-variance-plots.png "PCA Variance by Component")

<br>
As we can see in the top plot, **PCA** works in a way where the first component holds the most variance and each subsequent component holds less and less.

The second plot shows this as a cumulative measure - and we can see how many components we would need to retain in order to keep any amount of variance from the original feature set. 

Based upon the cumulative plot above, we can see that we could keep 75% of the variance from the original feature set with only around 25 components - in other words, with only a quarter of the number of features we can still hold onto around three-quarters of the information.

___
<br>
# APPLYING OUR PCA SOLUTION <a name="pca-application"></a>

Now that we've run our analysis of variance by component, we can apply our **PCA** solution.

In the code below, we *re-instantiate* our **PCA** object, except this time specifying that we want the number of components that will keep 75% of the initial variance.

We then apply this solution to both our training set (using `fit_transform`) and our test set (using `transform` only).

Finally, based on this 75% threshold, we confirm the number of components this leaves us with.

<br>
```python
# Re-instantiate our PCA object (keeping 75% of variance)
pca = PCA(n_components=0.75,  random_state=42)

# Fit to our data
X_train = pca.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = pca.transform(X_test)

# Check the number of components
print(pca.n_components_)
```

<br>
Turns out we were almost correct from looking at our chart - we will retain 75% of the information from our initial feature set with only 24 principal components.

Our `X_train` and `X_test` objects now contain 24 columns, each representing one of the **principal components**. We can see a sample of `X_train` below:

| **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **…** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| -0.402194 | -0.756999 | 0.219247 | -0.0995449 | 0.0527621 | 0.0968236 | -0.0500932 | … |

<br>
Here, column "0" represents the first component, column "1" represents the second component, and so on. These are the input variables we will feed into our classification model to predict which customers purchased Ed Sheeran's last album!

___
<br>
# CLASSIFICATION MODEL <a name="pca-classification"></a>

##### Training The Classifier

To start with, we will simply apply a **Random Forest Classifier** to see if it is possible to predict based upon our set of 24 components.  

In the code below we instantiate the **Random Forest** using the default parameters and then fit this to our data.

<br>
```python
# Instantiate our model object
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 42)

# Fit our model using our training & test sets
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

<br>
##### Classification Performance

In the code below we use the trained classifier to predict on the test set and run a simple analysis for the classification accuracy of the predictions vs. actuals.

<br>
```python
# Predict on the test set
y_pred_class = clf.predict(X_test)

# Assess the classification accuracy
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_class)
```

<br>
The result of this is a **93%** classification accuracy, in other words, using a classifier trained on 24 principal components we were able to accurately predict which test set customers purchased Ed Sheeran's last album, with an accuracy of 93%.

___
<br>
# APPLICATION <a name="kmeans-application"></a>

Based on this proof-of-concept, we could go back to the client and recommend that they purchase some up-to-date listening data. We could then apply **PCA** to this, create the components, and predict which customers are likely to buy Ed's *next* album.

___
<br>
# GROWTH & NEXT STEPS <a name="growth-next-steps"></a>

We only tested one type of classifier here (**Random Forest**) - it would be worthwhile testing others. We also only used the default classifier hyperparameters - we would want to optimiZe these.

Here, we selected 24 components based upon the fact this accounted for 75% of the variance of the initial feature set. We would instead look to search for the optimal number of components to use based upon classification accuracy.
